# ANN
This was a Final Project for COMP 221 at Macalester College. I implemented a LSTM network using PyBrain in order to test for efficiency of time and accuracy of data. My other 2 group members implemented slightly different models.

This is a simple implementation of a LSTM network using PyBrain for the purpose of a Final Project in COMP 221 Fall 2015. I did most of what I wanted to do with this project. However, I did not completely understand how PyBrain implemented LSTM networks and how layers and nodes worked. If given the oppurtunity, I would instead try to delve into TensorFlow to try and understand the smaller details better.
